# Welcome

## About

Welcome to the official documentation for the [**BreMea Development**](https://bremea.com/) API. This will document how to use the REST API for interacting with projects built by [**BreMea Development**](https://bremea.com/). The API currently services the main site and [**CountBot**](https://bremea.gitbook.io/countbot/).

## Limits

The current query limit is **one** request per **three** seconds. In the future, this limit can be changed with an application request.
